  "title": "Implement Timestamp-based UUID Generator in Obsidian",
"description": "Add a command to Obsidian that generates a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) based on the current timestamp and inserts it into the active note at the cursor position.",  "requirements": [
    "The command must be accessible via Obsidian's command palette.",
    "It should generate a UUID using the current timestamp, following the UUID v7 standard.",
    "The generated UUID must be inserted at the current cursor position in the active note.",
    "If no note is active when the command is executed, an appropriate error message should be displayed."
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "The command is visible in Obsidian's command palette when searched.",
    "When the command is executed with an active note, a valid UUID v7 is generated and inserted at the cursor position.",
    "The generated UUID is unique and correctly formatted according to the UUID v7 standard.",
    "If no note is active when the command is executed, an error message is displayed to the user."
